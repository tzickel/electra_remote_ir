    "*Notice* This document is for the fairly recent versions of raspbian (mid-2019). Previous versions (with older kernels such as 4.14 in stretch) had lirc support built-in, but newer versions (kernel 4.19+ in buster) do not come with it but instead have a new built-in kernel driver called gpio-ir & gpio-ir-tx and use the userland programs ir-keyspace and ir-ctl (lirc can be compiled to use them as well).\n",

    "Also this document is for talking with my remote, other remotes might use standard protocols which gpio-ir already supports, if not perhaps you can find useful tips and code to help you figure out your remote."
